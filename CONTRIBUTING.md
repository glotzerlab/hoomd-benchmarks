# Contributing to hoomd-benchmarks

Contributions are welcomed via [pull requests][pulls]. Contact the **HOOMD-blue** developers before
starting work to ensure it meshes well with the planned development direction and standards set for
the project.

## Implement functionality in a general and flexible fashion

New features should be applicable to a variety of use-cases. The **HOOMD-blue** developers can
assist you in designing flexible interfaces.

## Base your work off the correct branch

All new work should be based off the `master` branch.

## Propose a minimal set of related changes

All changes in a pull request should be closely related. Multiple change sets that are loosely
coupled should be proposed in separate pull requests.

## Agree to the Contributor Agreement

All contributors must agree to the [Contributor Agreement](ContributorAgreement.md) before their
pull request can be merged.

## Use a consistent style

Follow the [HOOMD-blue style guide][style_guide].

## Document code with comments

Use python docstrings for classes, functions, attributes, modules, and packages. Also comment
complex sections of code so that other developers can understand them.

## Write user documentation

Document public-facing API with Python docstrings in Google style.

## Add developer to the credits

Update the credits documentation to reference what each developer contributed to
the code.
